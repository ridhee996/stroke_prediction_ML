# Stroke prediction system using Machine learning
The project “Stroke prediction system” is implemented using various machine learning techniques allowing us to make predictions about possible outcomes based on historical data.
The project is based on a dataset of varying attributes concerning about lifestyle or medical health of an individual which will be used to train and test the models after feature selection to increase the accuracy of the models.

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
The first step in the methodology is to collect relevant medical data from different sources, including electronic health records, lifestyle factors, and genetic data. Here, we have used dataset available on Kaggle named as “Stroke prediction dataset”. The collected data will then be preprocessed, which includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and data normalization.

2. Data Visualization:
In this step, different visualizations techniques, including scatter plots, histograms, and box plots, will be used to analyze the distribution, correlation, and outliers in the collected data. This can help in understanding the patterns and relationships between different variables and identifying any anomalies or outliers in the data.

3. Data Transformation:
In this step, different data transformation techniques, including scaling, normalization, and encoding, will be applied to the collected data. This can help in improving the quality of the data and making it more suitable for machine learning algorithms.

4.	Feature Engineering:
In this step, different feature engineering techniques, including feature scaling, feature selection, and feature extraction, will be used to create new features or modify existing features in the collected data. This can help in reducing the dimensionality of the data and improving the performance of the machine learning model.

5.	Model Selection and Training:
Different machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks, will be trained using the preprocessed data. The performance of different algorithms will be evaluated using cross-validation techniques, and the most accurate and reliable algorithm will be selected for the final model.

6.	Model Evaluation:
The next step is to evaluate the performance of the developed model using different performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The performance of the system will be compared to existing stroke prediction models and evaluated for its effectiveness in predicting the risk of stroke in individuals.
